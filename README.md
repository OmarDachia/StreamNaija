## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

Got it! If you're **cloning a Laravel 12 project that uses Vite from a repository**, here are the **setup instructions** step-by-step:

---

## âœ… 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-laravel-project.git
cd your-laravel-project


## âœ… 2. Install PHP Dependencies

Make sure you have PHP â‰¥ 8.2 and Composer installed.

composer install

## âœ… 3. Install Node Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js â‰¥ 16 and npm or yarn.


npm install

php artisan key:generate

Update `.env` with your database and app settings.

## âœ… 5. Run Database Migrations

Make sure your database is set up and running:

php artisan migrate

## âœ… 6. Build Frontend Assets with Vite

For development:

npm run dev

For production build:

npm run build


## âœ… 7. Start the Laravel Development Server

php artisan serve

Your app should now be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## âœ… 8. If Using Vue or React

Make sure the correct frontend framework is installed:

- For Vue:
  
  npm install vue
 
  

And ensure your `vite.config.js` is set up accordingly.
